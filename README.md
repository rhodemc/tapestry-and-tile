## Description

I was motivated to create a portfolio because I wanted to showcase my work and skills to potential employers. It is easy to navigate and provides a brief overview of my background and experience. It also provides links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles.

## Installation

NA

## Usage and Testing

To use my portfolio, follow the links in the navbar to the different sections of the page. The 'About Me' section provides a brief overview of my background and experience. The 'Portfolio' section provides links to my projects. The 'Contact' section provides a form to message me and the Resume sections provides a link to my resume and a list of skills. 

Future updates will include a footer with links to linkedin, github, and email, hover effects over the portfolio links and working links.

## Credits

This app was built with help from a React portfolio tutorial found online. I used the tutorial to help me get started with the basic layout and components. I then customized the app to fit my needs and style.
